# **ðŸ“Œ Commit Message Guidelines**  

## **ðŸ”¹ Why Follow a Commit Message Standard?**  
Clear and structured commit messages help in:  
âœ… Making the Git history **more readable** and **organized**.  
âœ… Helping **collaborators and reviewers** understand changes quickly.  
âœ… Ensuring **better tracking of features, fixes, and improvements**.  
âœ… Making debugging easier by identifying past changes efficiently.

## **âœ… Commit Message Format**

- **feat:** A new feature implementation.

## **ðŸ”¹ Commit Message Best Practices**  
âœ… **Use prefixes (`feat`, `fix`, `style`, `refactor`, `chore`)** for clarity.  
âœ… **Write in present tense** (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").  
âœ… **Keep messages concise but meaningful** (first line â‰¤50 characters).  
âœ… **Use bullet points in the description** (if needed).  
âœ… **Make frequent commits** to track progress clearly.

Following this commit message structure ensures:  
- **Better collaboration** in teams.
